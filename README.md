# NER-using-Deep-Learning
A project on achieving  Named-Entity Recognition using Deep Learning.

As the [page on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) says, **Named-entity recognition (NER)** (also known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

Take a look at this example:

> _Jim bought 300 shares of Acme Corp. in 2006._

Applying method of NER method, we must get:

> _[Jim]<sub>Person</sub> bought 300 shares of [Acme Corp.]<sub>Organization</sub> in [2006]<sub>Time</sub>._

I am doing project under the guidance of [Dr. A. K. Singh](http://www.iitbhu.ac.in/cse/index.php/people/faculty/37.html). I will be adding all relevant work I do regarding this project. Check out all the subfolders for my work.
